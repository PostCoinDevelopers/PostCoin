#PostCoin - Integration in the Future

Forming the idea of the development of the PostCoin, we turned to the experiences of successful projects outside the crypto-area, in the real world. For the project to become commercially successful needs a clear plan and resources to implement it in the reality. Unfortunately, most startups and the cryptocurrency poorly represent the realization of their ideas. Unlike the most other startups, we have a specific goal to create a commercially successful project. This approach fully reflects the interests of PostCoin investors.
To achieve the goal, we have decided to combine new technologies and schemes of creating successful business projects.
Development of the PostCoin is based on the mutual integration in information projects and business portals. Much attention is paid to supporting the long-term investors. This approach makes the less profitable short-term speculation and more attractive long-term investments.

###Integration of information projects
The main purpose of the information resource Crypto-Compass is acquainting the people with the possibilities of the Crypto-universe. Less than 1% of the people who are living on the planet are familiar with the cryptocurrency. Between the developers, startups and the ordinary people, a vast gulf of a misunderstanding has formed.
The purpose of the information and training resources is eliminating this abyss, becoming the connecting bridge between new technologies and the world, outside of the crypto audience. The projects will get profits from the advertising, content placements and other services. A part of the profits will be distributed among the holders of the PostCoin who belongs to the three higher ranks. The transparency and the public control of payments are guaranteed by the blockchain.
